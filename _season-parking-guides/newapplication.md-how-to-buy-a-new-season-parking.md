# What are the types of season parking?
There are 3 types of season parking
1. Long-Term Season Parking - Parking in a car park for **more than one month**, enjoy pro-rated charges
2. Short-Term Season Parking - Parking in a car park for **less than one month**, pay for full month
3. Family Season Parking - Parking in a family member's car park, add on half the price of the original season parking

### Why are the charges different?
As season parking is for **long-term use and sold on a calendar month basis**, the charges for the types of season parking vary
#### 1. Long-term season parking 
A season parking that is longer than one month and hence enjoys a pro-rated pricing
#### Example 
1. It is the 9th of January 
2. You want to buy a season parking till the end of March
3. This is a long-term season parking as it is more than one month
4. You will enjoy pro-rated charges for January - you only pay for 9th January to 31st March

#### 2. Short-term season parking 
A season parking that expires at the end of the month of application and hence is charged full rate
#### Example 
1. It is the 9th of January 
2. You want to buy a season parking till the end of January only
3. This is a short-term season parking as it is less than one month
4. You will have to pay for 1st January to 31st January as season parking is sold on a calendar month basis
