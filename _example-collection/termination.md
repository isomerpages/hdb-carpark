# How do I terminate my season parking?
You can terminate your season parking via our Termination of Season Parking service if you do not need it anymore.
### Will I get a refund?
Yes, refunds are **calculated from the day after you do the termination.** 
#### Example 
1. You bought a season parking that starts in 1st January and expires on 31st March
2. You **terminate your season parking on 20th March**
3. You will receive a refund for 21st March (one day after termination was done) to 31st March
4. You can still park in the car park for the whole of 20th March

<br>We will credit the refund to your bank account within 2 weeks
### Why cant I terminate my season parking?
As season parking is for long-term use and sold on a calendar month basis, **termination of pro-rated season parking** (find out more here) is subject to fulfilment of a long-term period
### What is a pro-rated season parking and how long is the long-term period I have to fulfill before I can terminate it?
While season parking is sold on a calendar month basis, long term usage is rewarded with pro-rated charges for the first month if you purchase in the middle of the month. 

<br>Long-term usage is defined as minimally a pro-rated month and an additional month. 

<br>You can only terminate after this period is fulfilled.
#### Example
1. You bought a season parking that starts in 10th January and expires on 31st March
2. As your purchase is in the middle of the month, you will enjoy a pro-rated rate for the month of January
3. Due to this benefit, you can only terminate your season parking **after the pro-rated month (January) and the next month (February) has passed**
4. You can terminate your season parking from 1st March onwards
