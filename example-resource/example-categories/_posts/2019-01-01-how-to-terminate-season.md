Termination Procedure
<br>You can terminate your season parking if you do not need it anymore, and we will refund you the unexpired season parking charges. 
<br>Requests for a refund must be made prior to the termination, and we will not backdate refunds. 

<br>How to terminate?
<br>You can terminate your season parking via our Termination of Season Parking service.

<br>Will you get a refund?
<br>The amount of season parking charges to be refunded will be calculated from the day after you do the termination. 
<br>For example, 
1. Jack bought a season parking that expires on 31st January
2. Jack terminates his season parking on 20th January
3. Jack will receive a refund for 21st January to 31st January
4. Jack can still park in the car park for the whole of 20th January

First-time purchasers can apply season parking for the current month with full rate or buy a longer-term season parking with pro-rated charge for the current month plus following month(s). As season parking is for long-term use and sold on a calendar month basis, termination of the pro-rated season parking (i.e. current month and subsequent month) is not allowed.

For example, if you have purchased season parking from 13th Mar to 31st May, you would not be allowed to terminate and request for a refund of your season parking charges from 13th Mar to 30th Apr. You could however, apply to terminate your season parking on 30th Apr for your unused season parking charges from 1st May to 31st May.

Mode of refund
We will refund the unused portion of your season parking directly to your bank account within 2 weeks.
