You can terminate your season parking if you do not need it anymore, and we will refund you the unexpired season parking charges. 
<br>Requests for a refund must be made prior to the termination, and we will not backdate refunds. 

## How to terminate?
<br>You can terminate your season parking via our Termination of Season Parking service.

## Will I get a refund?
<br>The amount of season parking charges to be refunded will be **calculated from the day after you do the termination.** 
<br>For example, 
1. Jack bought a season parking that starts in 1st January and expires on 31st March
2. Jack terminates his season parking on 20th March
3. Jack will receive a refund for 20th March to 31st March
4. Jack can still park in the car park for the whole of 20th March
<br> You will receive your refund within 2 weeks

## Why cant I terminate my season parking?
As season parking is for long-term use and sold on a calendar month basis, **termination of pro-rated season parking** (find out more here) is subject to fulfilment of a specific period.
### What is a pro-rated season parking and when can I terminate it?
For example,
1. Jack bought a season parking that starts in 10th January and expires on 31st March
2. As Jack's purchase is in the middle of the month, he enjoys a pro-rated rate for the month of January
3. Due to this benefit, Jack can only terminate his season parking after the pro-rated month (January) and the next month (February) has passed
4. Jack can terminate his season parkinf from 1st March onwards
