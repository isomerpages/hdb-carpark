### How do I terminate my season parking?
You can terminate your season parking via our Termination of Season Parking service if you do not need it anymore.
### Will I get a refund?
Yes, refunds are **calculated from the day after you do the termination.** 

<br>For example, 
1. You bought a season parking that starts in 1st January and expires on 31st March
2. You **terminate your season parking on 20th March**
3. You will receive a refund for 21st March (one day after termination was done) to 31st March
4. You can still park in the car park for the whole of 20th March
<br>You will receive your refund via the payment mode you made e.g. credit card, bank account etc

#### Why cant I terminate my season parking?
As season parking is for long-term use and sold on a calendar month basis, **termination of pro-rated season parking** (find out more here) is subject to fulfilment of a specific period.
#### What is a pro-rated season parking and when can I terminate it?
For example,
1. You bought a season parking that starts in 10th January and expires on 31st March
2. As your purchase is in the middle of the month, you will enjoy a pro-rated rate for the month of January
3. Due to this benefit, you can only terminate your season parking **after the pro-rated month (January) and the next month (February) has passed**
4. You can terminate your season parking from 1st March onwards
